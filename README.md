Project Log Assignments

**2-2 Project Log: Team Formation and Project Design**

After reviewing the project scenarios outlined in the Final Project Guidelines and Rubric, the team selected the third person scenario set as a survival horror shooter within a cathedral environment. Based on this scenario, the following four additional gameplay elements were chosen for inclusion in the project:
- Power-up pickups
- Player equipment pickups
- Moving enemies
- Stationary obstacles

**Brainstormed Content Based on the Scenario**\
The game is designed as a third-person survival horror experience set in an archaic cathedral. The player begins in the catacombs and progresses through dangerous areas while attempting to escape the cathedral. The narrative centers on a time-travel mission where the player is sent from the future to stop a threat contained within the cathedral. Previous agents failed, leaving behind barriers and equipment for the player to use.

Gameplay content includes modern weapons and equipment (firearms & armor) contrasted against an ancient cathedral setting, enemy cultists guarding the area, and environmental traps. Armor plates, health items, ammunition, and temporary buffs such as adrenaline shots support the survival horror gameplay.

Power Pickups
- Consumable health item (quick use): Restores health upon use
- Ammo pickups: Ammunition for weapons
- Battery: Used for flashlight power
- Adrenaline shot: Temporarily increases player speed

Player Equipment
Armor Pickups
Armor plate system will be displayed as a bar above the health bar in 4 distinct chunks:
- Small armor plate: Restores 1 armor
- Medium armor plate: Restores 2 armor
- Large armor plate: Restores all 4 armor

Weapon Pickups
- Knife
- Pistol
- Shotgun
- Stretch Goal: Grenade

Enemy Types (Moving)
Enemies will comprise of the cathedrals cultists, being melee focused only.\
- Quicker: Fast movement, lower damage
- Tank: Slow movement, high damage

Obstacles (Stationary)
- Bear trap: Renders the player immobile and causes damage
- Saw trap: Deals damage and causes bleeding
- Pitfalls: Instant kill
- Barriers: Prevent progression and require key objects to continue

**Development Schedule and Timeline**\
The project development timeline follows the course structure and milestone deadlines:

- Weeks 1–4: Alpha development phase
- Week 5: Beta development phase
- Weeks 6–7: Polishing, bug fixing, and final submission preparation

This timeline ensures that core systems are implemented early and refined before final submission.

**Alpha and Beta Development Goals**\
Alpha Stage Goals (Completed by Week 4):
The Alpha stage focuses on establishing core gameplay systems and basic functionality. By the Alpha submission, the following elements should be in place:
- Basic player movement and combat functionality
- Enemy movement with simple AI behaviors (attacking)
- Functional stationary obstacles (traps)
- Player equipment pickups (weapons and armor)
- Power-up pickups with basic effects

Beta Stage Goals (Completed by Week 5):
The Beta stage focuses on refinement, content expansion, and level design. By the Beta submission, the following goals should be met:
- Fully designed level layout, with each team member contributing one room, with the fifth and final room being a larger collaborative effort
- Final enemy and obstacle placement
- Improved combat and interaction responsiveness
- Clear progression from start to end location

**Communication Methods & Communication Frequency**\
The team will use Discord as the primary communication platform. Discord voice channels will be used for meetings and live discussions, while text channels will serve as a persistent communication hub for updates, questions, and coordination between meetings. The team will hold a minimum of two check-ins per week. Tuesdays are designated as a consistent meeting day to ensure regular progress updates and alignment. Additional meetings may be scheduled as needed based on development requirements.

**Task Assignment and Reporting**\
All project tasks will be tracked using Trello. All team members are expected to report all in-progress and completed tasks using the dedicated card categories.  

All content was collaboratively developed by all members of the development team:

- Ziqura Thomas
- Amya Overton
